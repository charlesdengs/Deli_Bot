## Begin (July 1, 2023)


* Started inital drafting of model
    * Based model off 2 part system, Top and Bottom chassis. All electronics would be hosted on bottom, and payload and other top chassis could be switched out on top.
        
        * Potential top chassis include: carrier box, flat platform for ROV carrying, tools

    * Spent alot of time working on the wheels, wanted to be able to have a logo in the center of the wheel while hiding nut connecting shaft to wheel.
    
    * Calculated how much torque and rpm I needed.
        > Used Robotshop motor sizing tool: https://community.robotshop.com/blog/show/drive-motor-sizing-tool
        * Picked out motor: Traxxas 21t 550 motor, seems to have enough rpm and I plan on gearing down to 400rpm to be able to reach 5mph.
