## Begin (July 1, 2023)


* Started initial drafting of model
    * Based model off 2 part system, Top and Bottom chassis. All electronics would be hosted on the bottom, and payload and other top chassis could be switched out on top.
        
        * Potential top chassis include: carrier box, flat platform for ROV carrying, tools

    * Spent a lot of time working on the wheels, wanted to be able to have a logo in the center of the wheel while hiding the nut connecting the shaft to the wheel.
    
    * Calculated how much torque and rpm I needed.
        > Used Robotshop motor sizing tool: https://community.robotshop.com/blog/show/drive-motor-sizing-tool
        
        * My results: https://github.com/charlesdengs/Deli_Bot/blob/main/Progress%20Photos%20of%20CAD%20and%20Robot/MotorSizing.png
        * Picked out a motor: Traxxas 21t 550 motor, seems to have enough rpm and I plan on gearing down to 400 rpm to be able to reach 5mph.
