# **Deli Bot (Delivery Bot)**

## **What Is This Project?** </h2>

Over the summer before my last year of high school, I wanted to work on a project that reflected the interests I had in engineering and computing. This project is based on my love of vehicles and my fascination with the Starship delivery robots.

This project is designed to be mostly 3D printed, fitting most home 3d printers, and use affordable electronics to make this project available to anyone.

This project is inspired by the Starship Delivery Robot, but designed to fit a smaller scale, such as my high school campus.


## **Idea and Concept**
This robot is meant to carry different loads such as finished 3d prints, tools, food, and other things laying around. The robot will be able to connect to wifi via the school wifi and be driven from anywhere in the school.
